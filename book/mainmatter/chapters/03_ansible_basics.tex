\chapter{Ansible Basics: Understanding Playbooks}

You've dipped your toes into the waters of Ansible with ad-hoc commands. It's cool, sure--but it's only the beginning. The real magic happens with playbooks. Playbooks are the \textbf{A}rchitects of Ansible, the backbone of your automation. They turn your one-off commands into reusable, scalable workflows.

In this chapter, we'll break down what playbooks and tasks are, guide you through writing your first playbook, and introduce core modules like \texttt{file}, \texttt{copy}, and \texttt{service}. By the end, you'll feel like you've just unlocked the next level of automation.

\section{What are Playbooks and Tasks?}

Think of a playbook as a \textbf{N}arrative for your automation. It's a step-by-step story of what you want Ansible to do, written in YAML. Each chapter of the story is a task, and each task tells Ansible what action to take.

Here's the cool part: Playbooks are human-readable. They don't hide behind cryptic syntax. A quick glance, and you'll know exactly what's happening.

Here's what a simple playbook might look like:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, caption=Example Playbook: Basic Setup]
- name: Ensure a directory exists
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create a directory
      file:
        path: /tmp/example
        state: directory
\end{lstlisting}

In this example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{name} field describes what each step does. It's purely for your benefit (and your teammates' sanity).
    \item The \texttt{file} module is the hero here, ensuring the directory exists.
    \item The \texttt{tasks} section contains all the individual actions you want to perform.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Think of it this way: A playbook is your orchestra, and each task is an instrument. Together, they create a symphony of automation.}

\section{Writing Your First Playbook}

Let's write a \textbf{s}imple playbook to create a directory, copy a file into it, and ensure a service is running. Open your favorite text editor and create a file called \texttt{example-playbook.yml}.

Here's what it might look like:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, caption=Your First Playbook]
- name: Basic Setup
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create a directory
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/example
        state: directory

    - name: Copy a file
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: example.txt
        dest: /tmp/example/example.txt

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
\end{lstlisting}

Let's break it down:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{ansible.builtin.file} module creates a directory.
    \item The \texttt{ansible.builtin.copy} module moves a file from your control node to the target machine.
    \item The \texttt{ansible.builtin.service} module ensures the Apache service is running. (Because no one likes a stopped web server.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running the Playbook}

To run your playbook, use the \texttt{ansible-playbook} command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Running Your Playbook]
ansible-playbook -i inventory example-playbook.yml
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{B}ask in the glory of automation as Ansible executes each task. You'll see output detailing what's happening, including what's changed.

\section{Core Modules: File, Copy, Service}

Modules are like \textbf{I}ngredients in your automation recipe. Ansible provides hundreds of them, but for now, we'll focus on three essential ones: \texttt{file}, \texttt{copy}, and \texttt{service}.

\subsection{\texttt{file}}

The \texttt{file} module is your go-to for managing files and directories. You can use it to create, delete, or modify files and directories. Here's an example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, caption=Using the File Module]
- name: Ensure a directory exists
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /var/log/example
    state: directory
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{\texttt{copy}}

The \texttt{copy} module lets you copy files from your control node to the managed machines. It's great for deploying configuration files, scripts, or static assets.

Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, caption=Using the Copy Module]
- name: Copy a configuration file
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: nginx.conf
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{\texttt{service}}

The \texttt{service} module ensures that services (like Apache or Nginx) are started, stopped, or restarted. It's your \textbf{L}oyal ally in managing system services.

Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, caption=Using the Service Module]
- name: Start and enable Apache
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: yes
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \texttt{enabled: yes} ensures the service starts automatically on reboot.

\section{Wrapping Up}

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first playbook, learned about tasks, and explored three core modules. Playbooks are the heart of Ansible, turning individual commands into cohesive, reusable automation workflows.
