{\Large\textit{Dedication}}\\[3cm]

\begin{em}
To the seekers of elegant automation,\\
the craftspeople of infrastructure,\\
and the believers in the power of code.\\[2em]

To those who understand that\\
true automation is not just about efficiency,\\
but about creating space for human creativity.\\[2em]

And especially to all who embrace\\
the philosophy that simplicity\\
is the ultimate sophistication.\\[2em]

May this guide light your path\\
through the elegant world of Ansible,\\
where complexity yields to clarity,\\
and chaos transforms into harmony.\\[3em]

\vspace{1cm}  % Extra space before personal dedication

{\small
And most importantly,\\
To my partner in life Beatriz,\\
for her patience and support\\
and for being my best friend,\\
strongest critic, and most trusted confidant.}
\end{em}
